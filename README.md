# Things They Did Wrong

- Bob and Carol should have entered "git pull origin main" on their new branch before adding additional information to the branch. They should be always working on seperate branches. There would be conflicts when they go to merge to keep conflicts to a minumum.

-They shouldn't have put anything on main branch in the later part of the lab.
